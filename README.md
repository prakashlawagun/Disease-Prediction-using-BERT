# Disease Prediction system  using BERT and Random Forest
The Disease Prediction system utilizes a powerful combination of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for natural language processing and Random Forest for efficient prediction. This innovative approach leverages BERT's contextual understanding of medical text data to extract relevant features, which are then fed into a Random Forest model for accurate disease prediction. This fusion of advanced language processing and machine learning enhances the system's ability to analyze and forecast health conditions, contributing to more effective and timely diagnosis.
